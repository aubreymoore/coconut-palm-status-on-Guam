# Towards a Conservation Plan for Coconut Palms on Guam

The following is a quote from Moore 2018.

>Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown treesnake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known: the trees are dying. It is estimated that 90% of Guam's endemic cycads, locally known as fadang, have been killed by a coalition of recently-arrived invasive insects which includes a scale insect, a leafmining moth, and a defoliating butterfly. Fadang was listed as being the most abundant tree in Guam's forests in a 2002 forestry survey (Donnegon et al. 2004). This plant was added to the National Endangered Species List in 2015. The same 2002 forestry survey listed coconut palm as the second most abundant tree on Guam. During recent years, many coconuts and other palms on Guam have been severely damaged and killed by the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB). There is no estimate for the proportion of palms killed but it is obvious to residents and visitors that the island's palms are being killed at an alarming rate.

Not much has changed since I wrote this. Cycads and coconut palms are still being killed at a high rate by invasive insects. For cycads, the main culprit is the cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS) which was first detected in 2003 and for coconut palms it is coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) which was first detected in 2007.

The situation on Guam is globally unique in that we are rapidly losing our top two most abundant trees simultaneously.  Since arrival of CAS, the Guam cycad population has been reduced by 96% (Marler and Krishnapillai 2020). There is no equivalent estimate for coconut palm population reduction since arrival of CRB. Both tree species are clearly endangered and need to be protected. However, neither species is currently rare. Of 49 tree species listed in the most recent US Forest Service FIA report (Lazaro et al. 2020), coconut palm ranked 15 in abundance and fadang ranked 15. (Unfortunately, data from the 2024 FIA survey are not yet available.)

In my opinion, conservation efforts to protect cycads and coconut palms on Guam and species species dependant on these plants are not likely to succeed without implementing self-sustaining biological control for CAS and CRB. 

## CRB from a historical perspective

CRB is endemic to Southeast Asia. In its native range, it is not a major pest of coconuts and oil palms except following natural events such as typhoons or large scale destruction by humans associated with agricultural land clearing, large construction projects, and war. These events produced increased food availability for CRB grubs in the form of piles of decaying vegetation. Normally, CRB populations are kept at very low population density by 'natural enemies' which include predators, parasites and pathogens. Within its native range, CRB populations are controlled by an insect pathogen called Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV). Infection rates often exceed 70%.

>Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus 1758) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae), commonly known as the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), is endemic to the tropical Asia region (including South East Asia). CRB damages both coconut and oil palm, and can sometimes kill palms when adults bore into crowns to feed on sap (Bedford, 2013a, 2013b). The beetle was inadvertently introduced into the Pacific in 1909 when infested rubber tree plants were transported to Samoa from Sri Lanka (previously known as Ceylon) (Catley, 1969). The pest rapidly multiplied in Samoa and subsequently spread to several nearby Polynesian islands. Separate invasions further distributed CRB through Palau, parts of Papua New Guinea, and other Pacific nations through disruptions and uncontrolled movements during World War II (Catley, 1969; Gressitt, 1953). The invasive phase of the beetle was brought under control by the discovery and distribution of a viral biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; previously known as Rhabdiovirus oryctes and Baculovirus oryctes). OrNV is currently present and causes persistent population suppression on many of the CRB infested Pacific Islands (Bedford, 2013b; Huger, 2005).

>Virus introduction into affected Pacific Island countries and territories suppressed and weakened the CRB populations such that its spread into the Pacific islands ceased and for 30 years there was no further expansion of the range of CRB (Secretariat of the Pacific Community, 2015). Outbreaks of the beetle can still occur in conditions that provide an abundance of breeding sites, such as after cyclones or felling of mature palms for plantation replanting. The strategy for CRB management has been sanitation, coupled with population suppression using OrNV as a biocontrol (Jackson, 2009). The use of PCR in monitoring has shown that virus is regularly found in adult beetle populations, where the incidence can be over 70% (Ramle et al., 2005).

>After the success of the OrNV biocontrol programme (Huger, 2005) it was surprising to see a new CRB invasion on Guam in 2007. Following a failed eradication attempt, the beetle has since spread across the whole island (Moore, personal communication). The Guam CRB population has proven to be recalcitrant to infection using commonly
applied OrNV isolates that cause disease in other CRB populations (Moore and Jackson, unpublished). Additionally, new CRB invasions have also since been reported in Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea; 2009), O’ahu (Hawai’i, USA; 2013), and Honiara (Solomon Islands; 2015).


## Regional perspective

## Local perspective

## Existing action plans

There are several existing action plans which aim to protect coconut palms on Guam and other Pacific islands including the 2017-2019 Guam Invasive Species Management Plan (Guam Invasive Species Council 2017), the Guam Forest Action Plan (Fejeran 2021), and the Strategic Action Plan for Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (Pacific Ecological Security Conference 2022).
