# Towards a Conservation Plan for Coconut Palms on Guam

The following is a quote from an article I published 2018 [1].

Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown treesnake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known: the trees are dying. It is estimated that 90% of Guam's endemic cycads, locally known as fadang, have been killed by a coalition of recently-arrived invasive insects which includes a scale insect, a leafmining moth, and a defoliating butterfly. Fadang was listed as being the most abundant tree in Guam's forests in a 2002 forestry survey [1] This plant was added to the National Endangered Species List in 2015 [2]. The same 2002 forestry survey listed coconut palm as the second most abundant tree on Guam. During recent years, many coconuts and other palms on Guam have been severely damaged and killed by the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) (Figure 1). There is no estimate for the proportion of palms killed but it is obvious to residents and visitors that the island's palms are being killed at an alarming rate.
