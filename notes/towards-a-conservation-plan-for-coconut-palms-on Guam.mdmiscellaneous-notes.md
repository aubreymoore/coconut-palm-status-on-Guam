# Towards a Conservation Plan for Coconut Palms on Guam

The following is a quote from Moore 2018.

>Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown treesnake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known: the trees are dying. It is estimated that 90% of Guam's endemic cycads, locally known as fadang, have been killed by a coalition of recently-arrived invasive insects which includes a scale insect, a leafmining moth, and a defoliating butterfly. Fadang was listed as being the most abundant tree in Guam's forests in a 2002 forestry survey (Donnegon et al. 2004). This plant was added to the National Endangered Species List in 2015. The same 2002 forestry survey listed coconut palm as the second most abundant tree on Guam. During recent years, many coconuts and other palms on Guam have been severely damaged and killed by the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB). There is no estimate for the proportion of palms killed but it is obvious to residents and visitors that the island's palms are being killed at an alarming rate.

Not much has changed since I wrote this. Cycads and coconut palms are still being killed at a high rate by invasive insects. For cycads, the main culprit is the cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS) which was first detected in 2003 and for coconut palms it is coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) which was first detected in 2007.

The situation on Guam is globally unique in that we are rapidly losing our top two most abundant trees simultaneously.  Since arrival of CAS, the Guam cycad population has been reduced by 96% (Marler and Krishnapillai 2020). There is no equivalent estimate for coconut palm population reduction since arrival of CRB. Both tree species are clearly endangered and need to be protected. However, neither species is currently rare. Of 49 tree species listed in the most recent US Forest Service FIA report (Lazaro et al. 2020), coconut palm ranked 15 in abundance and fadang ranked 15. (Unfortunately, data from the 2024 FIA survey are not yet available.)

In my opinion, conservation efforts to protect cycads and coconut palms on Guam and species species dependant on these plants are not likely to succeed without implementing self-sustaining biological control for CAS and CRB. 

## Historical perspective

## Regional perspective

## Local perspective

## Existing action plans

There are several existing action plans which aim to protect coconut palms on Guam including the Guam Forest Action Plan (Fejeran 2021), Strategic Action Plan for Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (Pacific Ecological Security Conference 2022),
2017-2019 Guam Invasive Species Management Plan (Guam Invasive Species Council 2017).
