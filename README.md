# Coconut Palm Status on Guam

This repository is intended to facilitate sharing information on conserving coconut palms on Guam. 

Coconut palm, *Cocos nucifera*, was listed as the second most abundant tree in Guam's forests based on a 2003 survey.
However, the coconut plam population on Guam is in decline, mainly driven by coconut rhinoceros beetle, *Oryctes rhinoceros* which is killing large numbers of coconut palms throughout the island.
